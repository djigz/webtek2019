	<p>Way back April 22, 1997, a baby girl was born at the Benguet General Hospital, La Trinidad, Benguet.Which was me, Denyse Rae Cayadi. I am the second child of Mr. Franklin Cayadi and Mrs. Gemma Cayadi. I have three siblings namely Nicole Cayadi, Kobe Bryan Cayadi, and Naijel Cayadi. We are currently living at Lower Poblacion, Sablan Benguet.</p>

	<p>Being the second child of the family is a great experience for me. I was given everything that I want. I get to experience how to be a little sister and a big sister. Back then, when I was 4 years old, my parents sent me to school, a Kinder Garden School, at our Municipality since no one will look after me and since my aunt was the teacher of that section before. During those times was all about fun, toys, friends, singing, and dancing. I took up Kinder Garden twice because I was too young when I took it for the first time. Time passed by, when I entered elementary at Sablan Elementary School.I was a badminton player, a girl scout, and a drum and lyre member before. When I was a kid, I always wanted to become a doctor. It was fun being an elementary student for 7 years.</p>

	<p>After 7 years at my elementary school, I was sent by my parents at Saint Louis High School, Sablan Benguet, where I took up high school for 4 years. Being a high school student was way different from being an elementary student. Everything was getting to mature. When I was in high school, it was the time where I get to know more about life. It was the time when I started exploring new things that I didn't know before. I was able to meet a lot of people who have different personalities. When I was in high school my perspective in life has changed. I had joined different sports like basketball, scrabble, and domino. I also had joined different dancing competitions together with my friends. Even my dream of becoming a doctor has changed, when I was in high school, I wanted to become an Engineer, an Electronic and Computer Engineer. But it has changed when I entered college. </p>

	<p>I am now currently studying at Saint Louis University, Baguio City. But not as a Medical Technologist nor an Electronic and Computer Engineer but as an Information Technology student. Before I entered college I thought of taking up Doctor of Veterinary Medicine because I love dogs and I also love experiments, but then I ended up becoming an Information Technology student because my aunt told me that there is a bigger oppurtunity on this field. And since I didn't pursue Vetenarian I considered adopting dogs. Right now I have 3 dogs.</p>
