                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>What I like about this website is that you can get to know me without having to meet me personally. It's like we're connected where ever we are. Now that, that's over. These are just some of the things I would like you users to know and some of them you might think are weird (hopefully not). I like to be alone sometimes procrastinating, watching movies/videos, play games or even work on some personal projects. Whenever I get the extra time and motivation, I work on my craft.</p>
                    <p>My passion in life is Music, Sports, and Programming. Well not so much on programming but I'm getting there. So don't worry about any of that. My passion focuses more on sports and Music since these are what makes me feel good about myself, it boosts my confidence, and can make a bad day into a fun and exciting day. </p>
                    <p>My future leads me to where I'll be the hero of my own story. You might find things about me boring and dull but I think I can make it more interesting.</p>

                            <p>Honestly, I appreciate all types of genres. Blues, Country, Rock, Jazz, Funk, Pop, K-pop, ballad, reggae etc. They all have something in common that just makes me want to listen. Now, you might be wondering. Who might that guy in the picture be? He's actually one of my favorite singer/songwriter. I like the type of content he brings out. There's a lot of vibe to it and it just makes you want sing along(well atleast for me that is).</p>

                            <p>I can play the guitar but not as good as others play. I jsut know some simple chords and can play along to a couple of songs. Another would be the bass guitar but I would only know how to play it if someone was telling the chords while playing a song (I know what you're thinking. You think I don't deserve to mention that I play a little bit of the base. But I actually do know a bit). My main (and this is where I actually excell in wny other instruments) instrument is the drums. A lot of people told me that I'm actually good (not really good like mike portnoy or stephen phillips)  and others invited me to play in their band. Despite all the invitations I turned them all done because I already play in one where they really bring out my potential whenver I play with them.</p>

                            <p>Basketball has stuck by me almost my entire life. Getting my first dribble on the court just fascinated me and just by wathcing the adluts play gives me excitement and the motivation to train to be a better player. When I was in elementary I joined the basketball team in my school and met wonderful people who I got stronger with as the days go by. We played our hearts out everytime we had the opportunity to play because that's how much we loved basketball. Unfortunately, when I got to college I did not have the luxury of time to play with friends or even by myself. Sometimes I'm even lazy to play again. Suddenly my passion just vanished. Coming into my 3rd year college I somehow found it again with the help of friends and family. If it wasn't for them maybe I wouldn't have been playing at all, so big thanks to them.</p>

                            <p>Going up and down the hills with a bike is just nerve racking and exciting in the same time because you won't know wether you might fall and hurt yourself or succeed. *laughs* I go biking with my dad to keep our bodies in condition and we would go for almost 2km back and forth to our destination. You guys should try and biking with friends (it's more fun with more people especially for this kind of activity). </p>

                            <p>I was actually really scared of geting hurt and would avoid any kinds of fight as much as posible. Then one day I was told to enroll in a taekwondo class since my movements are sloppy and careless. Everytime I'd go to my session I would try to make excuses to not attend. Since time passes by I actually grew to love the sport (part of the reason is because I could kick other people) and went to every session. One thing I was actually scared of was sparring with other people because I always get matched up with good fighters. It's either that or I reallu just suck at it.</p>

                            <p>Those three images above are the programming languages I have knowledge on. Java has been with me since I started college, although I did not like it that much due to it's difficulty and I just didn't have the feel for it. I've got some of the basics down with python, currently learning other functionalities and technicalities to improve on. I've studied R with a magnificent programmer. He helped me studying R all throughout our journey together because I'm not that well coped when it comes to learning a new programming language. I'm not that confident with R but I still can deliver a proper and basic output for statistical problems.</p>

                            <p>I've got some skills on arduino where I apply my programming skills and knowledge on digital devices. Combining those I'm able to create a device which does what I want to do. I started with LED lights, controlling each individual light and what color lights up. I tried other projects but I didn't have the luxury of time to do so.</p>

                            <p>Design is a real pain in the butt (for me that is), well I only say that because I'm not that artistic when it comes to designs. If driven to do so I can somewhat deliver a not so much quality output. I do know also how to edit images in photoshop and inkscape. Taking a photo and turning to something it wasn't before is actually amazing. Creating backgrounds for websites or even wallpapers for phone. I also wanted to share my work of art but it always skipped my mind but if I ever do get to share my art I'll keep you guys updated.</p>
